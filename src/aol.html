              <span class="message__text">The first stage in the evolution of
          what we now know as the World Wide Web wasn’t explicitly named, but
          the era of Internet Relay Chat rooms and personally hosted HTML sites
          with services like Geocities would later be called Web 1.0. These
          sites had to be designed with the knowledge that users would be
          viewing them on small, low resolution monitors, and loading them onto
          consumer-grade hardware. User Interfaces had to be designed around
          these performance limitations, as readable as possible while taking up
          as little space as possible.</span>

              <span class="message__text">Yes. Without large, centralized
          social media platforms, web users would congregate in smaller
          communities based on more niche interests. Content on websites was
          consumed passively, where the websites were largely static and didn’t
          prompt users to contribute any content or interactions.</span>

              <span class="message__text"> I wouldn’t call it “boring,” there
          was definitely less overall content to interact with, but the
          limitations created by low bandwidth connections and less powerful
          computer hardware forced those online to find creative solutions for
          communicating with one another. One small example from the early
          2000’s was a website, "yourethemannowdog.com"</span>

              <span class="message__text"> Created by Max Goldberg, the website
          contains a single screenshot of Sean Connery tiled over and over to
          the size of the user’s browser window, and a looping sound clip from
          the movie Finding Forrester. Launched in 2001, the site gained enough
          traction that other Internet users began reproducing and hosting
          similar websites with different imagery. The bizarre form of these web
          pages are almost imperceptible without the memetic context users in
          the 2000’s would have.</span>

              <span class="message__text">This is an Internet Relay Chat,
          before websites were able to support real-time user communication,
          services like AOL Instant Messenger would connect users with
          text-based messages. These could be one-on-one interactions, or larger
          public groups focused on specific topics. Either way, Internet users
          would largely begin the practice of conversing with anonymous
          strangers and making real connections with people in a digital space.</span>
